# CSI_Dispersal

This repository contains open-source code, data, & text files for 

For information regarding the project, please visit: 

Project (1) Werba, J.A., A. Stucy, A.L. Peralta, and M.W. McCoy (In review) Effects of diversity and coalescence of species assemblages on ecosystem function at the margins of an environmental shift. 

Project (2) Stucy, A., M.E. Muscarella, J.A. Werba, A.L. Peralta, and M.W. McCoy (In preparation) Bacterial phylogeny-function relationships in historically freshwater ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to salinity transitions

## We address the following questions

Project (1)
* **Aim)**: How do the combined effects of salinity and mixing (via dispersal) influence aquatic community composition (zooplankton and bacterioplankton) and ecosystem function (carbon mineralization and litter decomposition) using an experimental salinization approach?

Project (2)
* **Aim)**: How does acute salinization affect microbial taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and function of freshwater microbial communities as estuarine aquatic communities and saltier conditions move in and persist? 

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:**: An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Mario Muscarella, Jo Werba, Alexandra Stucy, and Ariane Peralta containing functions used in analysis of soil and microbial sequence data.

* **bin:** 
	* *MothurTools.R*: An R script written by Mario Muscarella (Indiana University, now at University of Illinois) containing functions used in the analysis of community sequence data.

* **data:**: Files associated with soil and microbial data sets. 

* **figures:**: Figures (of zooplankton and bacterioplankton structure and function) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.

* **mothur:**: Files containing script for bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Illumina MiSeq platform) using mothur pipeline.
